I talked them into some 3d assets (using Threlte JS) to help them with personlisation and they loved that, bringing this feel of games to a website about games. I got to build the site using my favourite framework SvelteKit, so the DX was really nice for me. I also opted for a CMS, Prismic, so that Andy and George could take control of the content side and add/remove posts as they wanted.`;
