export const summary = `Throughout my journey as a Full Stack Engineer, I have been widely interested in the entire environment of Software Engineering, but have been most engaged by the front end. I have a passion for clean, scalable code and have proven skills in JavaScript & Typescript and supporting frameworks/libraries that solve creative problems. I'm an agile thinker and strong communicator, motivated to grow my skill-set through new challenging projects and prove my value in any endeavor I take on. My previous 
career as a Graphic Designer has given me a strong ability to talk design language 
as well as communicate with Product teams and align on the best possible user experience outcomes.`;

  `Moved our AzureB2B based authentication to Auth0, creating new APIs and business logic to account for secure communication to and from Auth0 as well as spinning up new architecture using Terraform and ensuring a seamless migration of customers (SSO included).`,
