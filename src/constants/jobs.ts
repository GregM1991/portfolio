    jobDescription:
      "Eq8 is a strategic workforce planning SaaS platform. I had a great experience working at eQ8, the team there are a fun bunch of people and we were never short of a good time. The platform's back end was built using C# and the .NET framework, with Azure Functions utilized for serverless computing, gRPC used for API communication, and both SQL and noSQL databases. The front end was built using C# Razor pages, but we were in the process of transitioning our front end to use React with Typescript.",
