		body: "I guess I'll let you be the judge of whether I'm a good human, but compassion, thoughtfulness and acceptance are principles I feel very strongly about. The world is a melting pot of different experiences, and I believe when we're comfortable to bring our life experiences to work, it only makes for a stronger and more effective team.",

I admire all that the Canva Foundation is trying to achieve, the simple but groundbreaking 2-step plan and the commitment to Pledge 1%. I would love to have more opportunities to volunteer, and Canva's Force For Good leave would allow me to execute on this value to a much greater degree.",

		body: "You can see this one in action right on this page, applying for Canva! Life gets stale when you don't see it with a big blue sky open above you. Setting out on this goal has already been a great introspective exercise, but it also intersects with a few other goals of mine.",

		title: 'Empower Others',
		body: "I've found this value to have a real hamster wheel effect on development. I cherish people who not only take the time to listen, but also to teach and set their team up for their own successes. The more I learn about my craft the more I realise how much I have to learn. Still, I love sharing my knowledge and leading more junior devs, especially as I find teaching to be one of the best ways to solidify my expertise.",

		body: 'Having two older brothers instilled a healthy sense of competition in me from as far back as I can remember. I think this plays a big part in my pursuit of excellence. I enjoy learning, honing the knowledge I pick up and hold a great sense of pride in my achievements (however big or small).',

		title: 'Make Complex Things Simple',
		body: "Over the course of my career this value has evolved into somewhat of a North Star for me. It's quite easy to over-engineer something that only needed a light touch, so it's important to take time at the beginning of a project to assess the most efficient path from A to B - I find this so valuable to achieving the best possible final product.",
